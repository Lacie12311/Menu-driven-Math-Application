# Menu-driven-Math-Application
The program allows users to practice basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can select the desired operation from a main menu and choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which adjusts the range of numbers used in the problems. The application generates random math problems based on the selected options and evaluates the user's answers, providing immediate feedback on correctness. The program tracks the total number of problems attempted and the number of correct answers, displaying the user's performance at the end.
